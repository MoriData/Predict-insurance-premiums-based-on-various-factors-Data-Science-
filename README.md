# Predict Insurance Premiums Based on Various Factors

This repository contains a data science project focused on predicting insurance premiums using various factors. The project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and forecast insurance premium costs based on demographic and contextual data.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates insurance premiums. The dataset includes features such as age, gender, BMI, region, smoking habits, and others that may influence premium calculations.

The project is structured to:
1. Explore and clean the dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and insights.
3. Train and evaluate machine learning models for prediction.
4. Fine-tune the best-performing model for optimal accuracy.
